# ðŸ“„ Lawyer Expert UAE â€“ Backend

## ðŸ”¹ Overview  
This backend powers the **Lawyer Expert UAE** platform, a system designed to help users manage and customize legal contracts.  
The main concept:  
- Users can **sign up and log in** securely.  
- They can **view and edit pre-defined legal contract templates**.  
- Every modification creates a **personal copy** of the contract linked to the userâ€™s account.  
- Users can return later to review and manage all contracts they have customized.

The project ensures secure authentication, contract storage, and efficient data handling.
